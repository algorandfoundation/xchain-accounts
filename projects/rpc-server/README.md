# RPC Server

Mock Ethereum JSON-RPC server that lets MetaMask Mobile connect to Algorand as a custom network. Deployed as a Cloudflare Worker.

## Supported Methods

| Method | Response |
|---|---|
| `eth_chainId` | `0x1040` (4160) |
| `net_version` | `4160` |
| `eth_blockNumber` | `0x1` |
| `eth_gasPrice` | `0x3b9aca00` (1 gwei) |
| `eth_getBlockByNumber` | Minimal mock block |
| `eth_getBalance` | Real ALGO balance from Algorand mainnet, converted from 6-decimal microAlgos to 18-decimal wei |

For `eth_getBalance`, the server uses [algo-x-evm-sdk](../evm-sdk/) to derive the Algorand address from the EVM address, then queries Algorand mainnet via algod.

## Development
